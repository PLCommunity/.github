- ✍️ We're working on reviving the community's most promising projects, like [🚀 javaboost](https://github.com/PLCommunity/javaboost), a modpack to improve your JE experience; and [📕 wiki](https://github.com/PLCommunity/plcommunity.github.io), a ("post"-)discontinued PojavLauncher wiki project
- ℹ️This team exists because of you, and without you, PojavLauncher won't also exist. We're grateful that we granted your wish to play Java Edition in your phone!
