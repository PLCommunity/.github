<div size='20px'> We're a group of people dedicated to making stuff about PojavLauncher.

<h2>About Us</h2>
<img width="55%" align="right" alt="Github" src="./assets/readme/git-header.svg"/>

- ‚úçÔ∏è We're working on reviving the community's most promising projects, like [üöÄ javaboost](https://github.com/PLCommunity/javaboost), a modpack to improve your JE experience; and [üìï wiki](https://github.com/PLCommunity/plcommunity.github.io), a ("post"-)discontinued PojavLauncher wiki project.
- We exist because of the PojavLauncher community; at the same time, we're also grateful that the Developers of this project granted our wish to play Minecraft: Java Edition in our mobile phones.

<h2>Contributing</h2>

Simple pull requests, like grammar fixes, small code changes, or directory refactors is already enough for us! :smile:
- We do not need you to hop into the "deepest" rabbit hole of coding.
